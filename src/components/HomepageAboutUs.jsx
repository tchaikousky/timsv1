            <p>Founded in 2020 by Thomas6Labs, TIMS has come a long way from its beginnings in a small garage in Stone Mountain, GA. When Thomas6Labs first started out, their passion for small business and small business needs drove them to learn the necessary tools so that Thomas6Labs can offer you the best inventory tracking and control system. We now serve customers all over Atlanta, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own inventory management solution.</p>
